    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ground Beef: </strong>We like using ground beef for this recipe, but you could substitute in ground turkey if it's what you have or like. Even ground venison would be nice if you have some in the freezer.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Sauce Ingredients: </strong>Making the sauce for this easy lasagna recipe is actually quite simple and fast. To the ground beef, we'll add tomato paste, a few classic spices like Italian seasoning and garlic powder, and crushed red pepper flakes for just a hint of heat.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Canned Tomatoes: </strong>Don't bother stewing your own; the tomatoes in the can are plenty good enough. If you have one of those 28-ounce cans of whole tomatoes, use it instead of the two smaller cans in the ingredients list. Just grab your kitchen shears, and chop up those tomatoes into nice 1/4-inch pieces.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>No-boil Noodles: </strong>If you have the regular lasagna noodles on hand and want to use them up, by all means boil some water, and pop those sheets of noodle in to cook. But to save time, we like the no-boil noodles which will tenderize while the rest of the dish bakes.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Cheeses: </strong>We have a trio (or quartet if you're creative) of cheeses that truly lift this dish beyond basic. First, the shredded mozzarella, ricotta or cottage cheese, and Parmesan cheese are spooned between the layers of pasta and sauce. Then, a final layer of fresh mozzarella slices is added just before the dish goes into the oven.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Preheat the oven to 350F</li>
      <br>
      <li> Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the ground beef, stirring to crumble, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain off the fat.</li>
      <br>
      <li> To the skillet of ground beef, add the tomatoes, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Place half of noodles in a lightly greased 12- x 8- x 2-inch baking dish, slightly overlapping lengthwise edges. Spoon one-third of the meat mixture over the noodles; add half of the shredded mozzarella, ricotta or cottage cheese, and Parmesan cheeses. Repeat layers, and spoon on the remaining meat mixture. Arrange the mozzarella slices on top. Cover the baking dish with foil. Bake at 350Â°F for 35 to 45 minutes. Remove the foil, and continue to bake for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Let the finished dish rest for 10 minutes before serving. Top with chopped parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
