    This recipe is my grandmother's. this will be the best chocolate cutout cookie you have ever tasted! Very chocolaty with a lot of taste! Everyone asks for the recipe when I bake these! The kids love them so its time to share!
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <strong><li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li></strong>
      <br>
      <strong><li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li></strong>
      <br>
      <strong><li>1 ¼ teaspoons baking powder</li></strong>
      <br>
      <strong><li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li></strong>
      <br>
      <strong><li>¾ cup butter, softened</li></strong>
      <br>
      <strong><li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li></strong>
      <br>
      <strong><li>1 egg</li></strong>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; set aside.</li>
      <br>
      <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg. Gradually stir in the sifted ingredients to form a soft dough. Divide dough into 2 pieces, flatten and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <br>
      <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Dough will be sticky so be sure to add more flour to the rolling surface as needed. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto cookie sheets.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
